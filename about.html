    <h2>COVID-19 monitor</h2>
    <p>This dashboard visualises the week-on-week change in coronavirus cases in English local authorities. Further information about coronavirus can be found at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus" target="_blank">gov.uk/coronavirus</a></p>
    <h3>Notes on the data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Confirmed cases are recorded up to 9am on the day of publication.</li>
        <li>The date of confirmed cases refers to the <em>specimen</em> date not the <em>reporting</em> date.</li>
        <li>The number of <em>confirmed</em> cases is likely to be much lower than the <em>total</em> number of cases because some people are asymptomatic and others may only have mild symptoms.</li>
        <li>Cases reported include those identified under pillar 1 (hospital) and pillar 2 (commercial labs and home tests) testing.</li>
        <li>There is a lag in the data shown because Public Health England <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/about-data" target="_blank">state</a> that the most recent cases are 'incomplete'.</li>
        <li>The data derives from Public Health England's <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk" target="_blank">Coronavirus Dashboard</a> and are  constantly being reviewed and corrected.</li>
        <li>Cases reported for Hackney are combined with the City of London and those for Cornwall are combined with the Isles of Scilly.</li>
        <li>The rate of cases is calculated by dividing the total number of cases by the <a href="https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/datasets/pestsyoala" target="_blank">mid-2019 estimate</a> of the resident population of each local authority multiplied by 100,000.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Further information about the data can be found at <a href="coronavirus.data.gov.uk/about" target="_blank">coronavirus.data.gov.uk/about</a></p>
    <h3>Interpreting the table</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The table rows are colour coded as red when the most recent week's incidence rate is 50 or more, amber when it is between 25 and 49, and green when it is 24 or less.</li>
    </ul>    
    <h3>Interpreting the chart</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The chart shows daily confirmed cases over time.</li>
        <li>The seven-day average is the average of a day and the previous six days of confirmed cases. It is left aligned because the most recently reported cases are 'incomplete' and therefore likely to change.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Interpreting the map</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The size of the circles in the map are proportional to the number of confirmed cases during the most recent week in each local authority district. </li>
        <li>The circles are coloured following change in the absolute number of cases: red (week-on-week increase), grey (no week-on-week change) or green (week-on-week decrease).</li>
    </ul>
